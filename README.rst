This scraper requires your username and password and performs the following tasks for you:

- login
- download of all agendas and motions related to upcoming meetings of committees and plenary sessions

  - Only considers meetings where you already have been invited formally through ALLRIS.

**IMPORTANT:**
All districts are supported but official committee abbreviations will only work for Eimsb端ttel as of now.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.7+
- Firefox installed
- `geckodriver binary`_ in PATH

.. _geckodriver binary: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Initial setup
-------------
1. Install ALLRIS scraper ``pip install twomartens.allrisscraper`` (you need Python 3.7+)
2. Run ALLRIS scraper a first time ``tm-allrisscraper`` (creates config ini in your current working directory)
3. Fill out the config file with your login credentials and an absolute path on your system to store PDFs of files

Configuration
-------------

.. code-block:: ini

    [Default]
    ; possible values for district: Altona, Bergedorf, Eimsb端ttel, Hamburg-Nord,
    ; Hamburg-Mitte, Harburg, Wandsbek
    district = Eimsb端ttel
    ; if you are not from Eimsb端ttel your domain ending will differ
    username = max.mustermann@eimsbuettel.de
    ; password is stored in clear text, therefore ini file should have most
    ; restrictive read permissions
    password = VerySecurePassword
    ; location for storage of PDFs (trailing slash is IMPORTANT)
    pdflocation = /path/to/storage/of/PDFs/

Usage after initial setup
-------------------------

Run ALLRIS scraper: ``tm-allrisscraper`` (takes a few seconds to finish)

In the specified location for download you will find the following structure:

- ``YYYY-MM-DD_Abbreviation of committee or plenary session/`` (one directory for each meeting)
- files inside the directory:
  ``Einladung.pdf`` (contains invitation), ``Mappe.pdf`` (contains all motions in one document), and ``Tagesordnung.pdf`` (agenda)
